# aws-console-hopper

AWS Console Hopper is a command-line utility designed to simplify the process of logging into multiple AWS accounts. The tool reads the contents of a directory containing multiple directories, each containing a credentials.csv file for an AWS account. The user is prompted to select an AWS account, and the tool opens the console login URL for the selected account. The tool also copies the password to the clipboard, making it easy for the user to paste it into the password field on the login page.

With AWS Console Hopper, managing and logging into multiple AWS accounts has never been easier. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or DevOps professional, this tool can help streamline your workflow and save you time.
